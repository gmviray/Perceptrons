# Perceptrons

This Python program implements the perceptron algorithm for binary classification tasks. The perceptron is a fundamental concept in the field of neural networks, representing a single-layer neural network with a single neuron. It takes a feature vector with n coordinates, assigns weights to each coordinate, and applies a threshold function to classify the input into one of two categories.
